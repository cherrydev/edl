== An Event should
* define the needed attributes
* support hash initialization
* support block initialization
* respond to ends_with_transition? with false if outgoing_transition_duration is zero
* respond to ends_with_transition? with true if outgoing_transition_duration set above zero
* respond to has_timewarp? with false if no timewarp assigned
* respond to has_timewarp? with true if a timewarp  is assigned
* report rec_length as a difference of record timecodes
* report rec_length_with_transition as a difference of record timecodes if no transition set
* add transition length to rec_length_with_transition if a transition is set
* return a default array for comments
* respond false to has_transition? if incoming transition is set
* respond true to has_transition? if incoming transition is set
* respond true to black? if reel is BL
* respond true to generator? if reel is BL or AX
* report src_length as rec_length_with_transition
* support capture_length as an alias to src_length
* delegate src_length to the timewarp if it is there
* report reverse? and reversed? based on the timewarp

== A Parser should
* store the passed framerate
* return matchers tuned with the passed framerate
* create a Timecode from stringified elements
* parse from a String
* parse from a File/IOish
* properly parse a dissolve
* return a spliced EDL if the sources allow

== A TimewarpMatcher should
* not create any extra events when used within a Parser
* properly describe a speedup
* properly describe a slomo

== A reverse timewarp EDL coming from Avid should
* be parsed properly

== A Final Cut Pro originating reverse should
* be interpreted properly (FAILURE - 1)

== EventMatcher should
* produce an Event
* produce an Event with dissolve
* set flag on the previous event in the stack when a dissolve is encountered (empty)
* generate a Wipe
* match the widest range of patterns
* pass the framerate that it received upon instantiation to the Timecodes being created

== CommentMatcher should
* match a comment
* apply the comment to the last clip on the stack

== ClipNameMatcher should
* match a clip name
* not match a simple comment
* apply the name to the last event on the stack

== EffectMatcher should
* not match a simple comment
* match a dissolve name
* apply the effect name to the transition of the last event on the stack

== A complex EDL passed via Parser should
* parse without errors
* be properly rewritten from zero

== A FinalCutPro speedup with fade at the end should
* be parsed cleanly

== A FinalCutPro speedup and reverse with fade at the end should
* parse cleanly (FAILURE - 2)
